## Who am I?
Hello! I'm Calin Baenen, an LGBTQ programmer born on October 30th, 2006.  
I enjoy playing games and helping people. I also enjoy programming as a hobby
and hope to make it my career.  
I am currently practicing Swedish and hope to practice Icelandic when I've mastered it (as well as I can).

I work in programming languages such as [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript),
[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C%2B%2B_Programming_Language), [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)), and others!  
  (My favorite is Rust.)
