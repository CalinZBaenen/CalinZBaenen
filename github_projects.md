## JavaScript
### ParseJS
[ParseJS](https://github.com/CalinZBaenen/ParseJS) is my crownjewel project.  
I made ParseJS when I was fifteen during my ninth schoolyear. It started as an idea for a program that would store tables in a compact but human-readable way, but it evolved when I decided I wanted to make a tokenizer and parser to make my job easier. In the end it turned into its own project.  
Check out [ParseJS' README](https://github.com/CalinZBaenen/ParseJS/blob/main/README.md) for more details.
### HotTea
[HotTea](https://github.com/CalinZBaenen/HotTea) is a an "eh" library. I am proud of it but I feel like it could have been implemented better.  
HotTea does its best at adding [statically typed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Static_typing) classes to JavaScript
by using [`Proxy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) to simulate datatype-related errors.



## Python
### F.O.O.L.
[Flexable Object Oriented Language](https://github.com/CalinZBaenen/NonBinariesNB_FlexableObjectOrientedLanguage) is one of my oldest publicly-shared projects (and it shows). F.O.O.L. was going to be a C-style language with features I felt would be helpful or neat.  
While the language is not practical and unfinished, it is still a charming novelty. - It has strings, numbers, booleans, and something that vaguely resembles an implemetation of [classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)).
